### android
This folder and projects follows the guide almost one for one on the implementation. This is an Android application built and tested only in the emulator.

### iOS
This folder takes the Android sample application and ports it to iOS. When working on this though an error was discovered with the Cloud Fetching so that portion was commented out and the [error message logged](iOS/custom-model-codelab/ErrorLogs.txt).

### Model
Contains the pre-trained model for the exercise.
